	<description>Changes the watermill generator in several different ways:
	* It now requires a research project called 'Hydroelectricity'
	* Increases its base power production from 1100W to 1400W
	* Its power production decreases if outdoor temperatures are below 10째C (50째F) or above 90째C (194째F)
	* Adds a new incident called 'Turbulent waters' which increases watermill power production by 50% but also damages them over time</description>
